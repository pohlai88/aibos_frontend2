# Project Status Snapshot

## Layout Structure
- **Global Implementation**: `<AppShell>` is implemented globally, ensuring consistent layout across all pages.

## Dashboard Views
- **Role-Based Widgets**:
  - **KPIWidget**: Rendered dynamically based on user role.
  - **TaskTimeline**: Available for roles with task management privileges.
  - **AIQuickActions**: Restricted to roles with AI interaction capabilities.

## Role Routing
- **Middleware Enforcement**: Role-based redirects are enforced via middleware, ensuring users access only authorized views.

## Sidebar
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Sidebar content dynamically adjusts based on user role, providing relevant navigation options.

## Login Behavior
- **Role Assignment**: Backend assigns roles upon login.
- **Persistence**: Role information is persisted across sessions.

## Page Polish
- **State Management**:
  - **Empty States**: Placeholder content is displayed for empty data scenarios.
  - **Loading States**: Loading indicators are implemented for asynchronous operations.
  - **Error States**: Error messages are displayed for failed operations.

## Accessibility and Mobile Readiness
- **Known Limitations**:
  - Accessibility testing is incomplete; potential gaps in ARIA roles and keyboard navigation.
  - Mobile responsiveness is partially implemented; some components require further optimization.
